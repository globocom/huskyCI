## Introduction

huskyCI is an open source tool that orchestrates security tests and centralizes all results into a database for further analysis and metrics. It can perform static security analysis in Python ([Bandit][Bandit] and [Safety][Safety]), Ruby ([Brakeman][Brakeman]), JavaScript ([Npm Audit][NpmAudit] and [Yarn Audit][YarnAudit]), Golang ([Gosec][Gosec]), and Java ([SpotBugs][SpotBugs] plus [Find Sec Bugs][FindSec]). It can also audit repositories for secrets like AWS Secret Keys, Private SSH Keys, and many others using [GitLeaks][Gitleaks].

## How does it work?

Developers can set up a new stage into their CI pipelines to check for vulnerabilities:

If security issues are found in the code, the severity, the confidence, the file, the line, and many more useful information can be shown, as exemplified:
